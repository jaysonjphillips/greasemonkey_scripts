Some Greasemonkey scripts that I needed, so I'm sharing.
Scripts:

======================================================================
Title: fb_remove_redundant_punctuation.js

Desc:  Tired of seeing the blatant disregard for Strunk & White's masterpiece,
       "The Elements of Style", I called upon GreaseMonkey to reign in
       grammatical deviants whose flippant and intentionally egregious
       use of exclamation points and other majestic punctuation marks
       must be stopped! That goes for malformed ellipses too. Punks.

Notes: Update by Jayson J. Phillips considerably cleans up script and makes
       it usable. See source for notes
